### Zaria Dancer






### Abstract
This paper aims to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), into customer service contexts and interactions. AIâ€™s ever-advancing technology presents potential benefits and challenges, and exploring scholarly sources and applied evidence provides a comprehensive base knowledge of how LLMs are utilized in customer service contexts. This paper explores the implications of all parties - businesses, consumers, and service workers - with as focus on key considerations like explainability, the need for human oversight, privacy and data concerns, and scalability.
